# Project Name

Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

You can use this app to track your daily feelings, comprehension, supportedness and add any additional comments you might have. Accessing the /admin route will let you review all feedback response which have been stored in the database. 

### Warning!
Some of the button elements are little buggy at the moment expecially the ones in the admin screen. If you click directly on the text of the delete button or directly on the flag icon it will not trigger any functions, but clicking to the sides, top, or bottom should execute just fine. Planning to fix in a future version.
